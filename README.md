Created a webscraper using the BeautifulSoup library that stores all the players that played for the Lions in the 2021 pre-season, and also played for the Lions in their 2023 pre-season games. Uses a loop to filter only players that played in both seasons, eliminating duplicates, and adds them to a list, tracking player retention.Applies the webscraper so that it also reads in each players' draft pedigree, position, birthdate, height, weight, and stats in the preseason. This is to try and identify reasons for why the player was still on the team.
